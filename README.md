This Flask Web application manages and displays the images taken on the Blockchain Camera. The Blockchain Camera takes realtime pixel data from a camera, and stores a hash of it on the blockchain. Can be used for verification of images in time they were taken, as well as method of creation. Possible use cases for verifying real vs fake images, which is becoming much more relevant in the world of highly realistic image generation and editing methods.
